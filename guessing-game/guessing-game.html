                <p>Welcome traveler!  <br> 
                    Do you have the dream to start a restaurant at the end of the Universe?
                    Or do you truly want to die by injecting liquid gold into your veins? <br> 
                    Boy-o-boy what a great coincedence. We are a casino!! <br>  <br> 
                    You can win tons of cool stuff and perhaps even money.
                    <br> 
                    Allow yourself to place you weary buttcheeks on the nearest comfortable surface and
                    ponder about what you are going to do with all that easy-earned cash.
                    <br>  <br>  We highly suggest to accomodate that thoughtflow with some hot leaf juice and to invest
                    in a good towel because those things come in darn handy.
